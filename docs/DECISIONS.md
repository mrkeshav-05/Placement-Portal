# Architectural Decisions

This is a lightweight decision log. Append a dated entry when changing a decision; do not rewrite history.

## 2026-07-12 — Full-stack Next.js

Use the Next.js App Router for UI, server actions, and route handlers so authorization and validation remain close to each workflow.

## 2026-07-12 — PostgreSQL and Prisma

Use PostgreSQL as the sole application database and Prisma as the sole ORM. Local development uses PostgreSQL 16 through Docker Compose.

## 2026-07-12 — Auth.js with JWT sessions

Use Google OAuth for institute accounts and JWT sessions for compatibility with database-free development credentials. Server-side route guards enforce roles.

## 2026-07-12 — Development credentials

Expose documented student/admin credentials only outside production so contributors can work before Google credentials are available.

## 2026-07-12 — Encrypted identity fields

Encrypt Aadhaar and PAN using AES-256-GCM with a 32-byte environment key. Store IV, authentication tag, and ciphertext together; never store plaintext.

## 2026-07-13 — Repository as shared agent memory

Treat `AGENTS.md` and `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` as the canonical onboarding context for humans and AI agents. Tool-specific instruction files must point back to these canonical files rather than duplicating project facts.
